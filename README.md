# Testing
## Validation

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

### W3C Markup Validator

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - I input the source code from each page into the validator and all pages received no errors or warnings.

## Further Testing

### Test Grid 

I created a testing grid on Apple Numbers which I used throughout the process of building this site. The grids have categories for each link/button to ensure all of them work correctly and redirect to a new tab if needed. There is also a grid to test responsive design for each section of the page, the different sections are outlined below.

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

-   The website was viewed and tested on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 10, iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro and iPad Pro.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly, as well as buttons and form submition and inputs.

-   I also did a good amount of testing the responsiveness of the website on different phone screens vertical and horizontal view, to make sure all the images and text are the correct size and position.

-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

-   Tested on all devices available on chrome developer tools.

## GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository, locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
